# Project Title
The partyPlanner is an application that will assist hosts of parties or small events to simplify administrative tasks associated to party planning.  

# Motivation
Currently, users aren't able to go to one place to get the lyrics for any songs that they are requesting for karaoke.  This application allows users to search for songs that they want, add it to a list, and when the song is selected, they can hear the song and see the lyrics to sing along.  

# Tech/framework used
 HTML, CSS, Spotify API, APISeeds Lyrics, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap

# Features
Spotify Music Player

# Installation
There is no need for a separate installation to use this application.  Navigate your web browser to https://joeyam8402b.github.io/partyPlanner/.

# API Reference
Two APIs were used for this project (API Seeds and Spotify).  API Seeds is used to obtain the artist name, artist song, and lyrics for the particular song.  Spotify is used to obtain a 30 second snippet of the song.


# How to use
Enter in the name of an artist and the song that you would like to hear.  Click on the button to get to the song and the lyrics will also display.  

# Future Additions
Future applications include a next up function where different users can submit songs that they want to sing to the queue as well as saving set playlists for future use.  
* Fixing and utilising /n received from API to have lyrics split instead of showing one big block
* Ability to queue songs dynamically without interrupting current song that is playing.
* Add containers to show list of upcomign singers that have already their selection
* Add pulsing effect to player whilst song is playing
* Allow for archiving the list of choices for future use by user
