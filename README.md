# Project Title
The partyPlanner is an application that will assist hosts of parties or small events to simplify administrative tasks associated to party planning.  

# Motivation
Currently, users aren't able to go to one place to get the lyrics for any songs that they are requesting for karaoke.  This application allows users to search for songs that they want, add it to a list, and when the song is selected, they can hear the song and see the lyrics to sing along.
